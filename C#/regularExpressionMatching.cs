We have two loops, one nested inside the other. The outer loop is controlled by the variable i, 
and it goes from 1 to m (the length of string s). The inner loop is controlled by the variable j, 
and it goes from 1 to n (the length of pattern p).

Inside these loops, we perform some checks and calculations. Here's what happens:

We check if the character at position j - 1 in the pattern p is equal to the character at 
position i - 1 in the string s, or if it is a dot ('.'). If it is, it means we have a match, and we set 
the corresponding value in the dp table to be the same as the value in the dp table for the previous 
positions i - 1 and j - 1. This is represented by dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1].

If the character at position j - 1 in the pattern p is an asterisk ('*'), we have a special case. We set
the current dp value to be the value two positions before in the same row, which is dp[i][j - 2]. This accounts 
for the scenario where the asterisk represents zero occurrences of the previous character in the pattern.

Additionally, if the character before the asterisk at position j - 2 in the pattern p is equal to the character 
at position i - 1 in the string s, or if it is a dot ('.'), we update the current dp value by performing a logical 
OR operation with the value at the previous row and the same column, dp[i - 1][j]. This accounts for the scenario where 
the asterisk represents one or more occurrences of the previous character in the pattern.

Finally, the function returns the value in the bottom-right cell of the dp table, which represents whether the entire 
pattern matches the entire string.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the code for a 5th grader! Let me know if you have any more questions.

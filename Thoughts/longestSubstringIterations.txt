 input string "abcabcbb"
 
 
1. Iteration 1: `end = 0`, character at `end` index is 'a'.
   - Since 'a' is not present in `char_dict`, we add it with its index: `char_dict = {'a': 0}`.
   - `max_length` remains 0.

2. Iteration 2: `end = 1`, character at `end` index is 'b'.
   - Since 'b' is not present in `char_dict`, we add it with its index: `char_dict = {'a': 0, 'b': 1}`.
   - `max_length` remains 0.

3. Iteration 3: `end = 2`, character at `end` index is 'c'.
   - Since 'c' is not present in `char_dict`, we add it with its index: `char_dict = {'a': 0, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}`.
   - `max_length` remains 0.

4. Iteration 4: `end = 3`, character at `end` index is 'a'.
   - 'a' is already present in `char_dict`, so we update the `start` index to the next index after the repeated character, which is `char_dict['a'] + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - `start` becomes 1.
   - Update `char_dict['a']` with the new index: `char_dict = {'a': 3, 'b': 1, 'c': 2}`.
   - Calculate the length of the current substring without repeating characters: `end - start + 1 = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3`.
   - Update `max_length` to 3.

5. Iteration 5: `end = 4`, character at `end` index is 'b'.
   - 'b' is not present in `char_dict`, so we add it with its index: `char_dict = {'a': 3, 'b': 4, 'c': 2}`.
   - Calculate the length of the current substring without repeating characters: `end - start + 1 = 4 - 1 + 1 = 4`.
   - Update `max_length` to 4.

6. Iteration 6: `end = 5`, character at `end` index is 'c'.
   - 'c' is already present in `char_dict`, so we update the `start` index to the next index after the repeated character, which is `char_dict['c'] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`.
   - `start` becomes 3.
   - Update `char_dict['c']` with the new index: `char_dict = {'a': 3, 'b': 4, 'c': 5}`.
   - Calculate the length of the current substring without repeating characters: `end - start + 1 = 5 - 3 + 1 = 3`.
   - `max_length` remains 4.

1. Python:

Python is known for its simplicity and readability. The code is concise and expressive.
It uses a class structure (class Solution) to encapsulate the solution.
Python provides built-in data structures like dictionaries to handle the storage of numbers and their indices.
Python supports dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare variable types.


2. Java:

Java is a statically typed language with a more verbose syntax compared to Python.
It uses classes (public class Solution) and methods (public static) to define the solution.
Java relies on the HashMap class from the java.util package for efficient key-value storage.
Java requires explicit declaration of variable types, offering strong type safety.


3. JavaScript:

JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted language mainly used for web development.
It uses a functional approach with the var and function keywords.
JavaScript employs the Map object, which is similar to a dictionary, for key-value storage.
JavaScript allows for more flexible variable typing and less strict syntax rules.


4. C#:

C# is a statically typed language developed by Microsoft, similar to Java in terms of syntax.
It uses classes (public class Solution) and methods (public int[] TwoSum) for structuring the solution.
C# utilizes the Dictionary class from the System.Collections.Generic namespace for efficient key-value storage.
C# supports both static and dynamic typing with the var keyword.

#Initialization:

We start by defining a class named Solution that contains a method called twoSum.
The twoSum method takes two parameters: nums (a list of numbers) and target (the target sum).
Inside the method, we create an empty dictionary called number_dictionary to store numbers and their indices.
Iteration:

We use a for loop to iterate over the nums list, tracking both the index (i) and the number (num) at each iteration.
Visual representation:
css
Copy code
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
css
Copy code
i=0, num=2
i=1, num=7
i=2, num=11
i=3, num=15

# Complement Calculation:

For each number (num) in the iteration, we calculate its complement by subtracting it from the target sum.
Visual representation:
makefile
Copy code
target = 9
makefile
Copy code
complement = target - num
makefile
Copy code
complement_1 = 9 - 2 = 7
complement_2 = 9 - 7 = 2
complement_3 = 9 - 11 = -2
complement_4 = 9 - 15 = -6
Checking Complement Existence:

We check if the current complement exists as a key in the number_dictionary dictionary.
If the complement exists, it means we have found a pair of numbers that sum up to the target.
In that case, we return a list containing the indices of the complement and the current number.
Visual representation:
makefile
Copy code
number_dictionary = {}
At the first iteration (complement = 7):
makefile
Copy code
complement_1 = 7
Since complement_1 is not in the dictionary, we move to the next iteration.
At the second iteration (complement = 2):
makefile
Copy code
complement_2 = 2
Since complement_2 is in the dictionary (key), we return the indices as a list: [number_dictionary[complement_2], i] = [0, 1].
The value 0 corresponds to the index of the number 2, and 1 corresponds to the index of the number 7.
We have found the solution, so we exit the loop and return the indices.
Storing Numbers in Dictionary:

If the complement does not exist in the dictionary, we store the current number (num) as a key and its index (i) as the value in the dictionary.
This allows us to keep track of the numbers we have encountered so far and their corresponding indices.
Visual representation:
yaml
Copy code
number_dictionary = {
    2: 0,
    7: 1
}
Return the Result:

After the loop ends, if we have not found a solution, we reach the end of the method.
At this point, we can assume that no two numbers in the nums list add up to the target sum.
Thus, we can handle this case based on the specific requirements of the problem (e.g., returning None or an empty list).
